SET THEORY
SET: A SET IS COLLECTION OF WELL DEFINED OBJECTS
EXAMPLE: SET A = {1,2,3,4}
COLLECTION - GROUP OF ITEMS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE A SET

CONDITION OF PROBABILITY 
P(A/B) = P(A INTERSECTION B)/P(B)

ODD PRIME NUMBER
THESE ARE PRIME NUMBERS THAT ARE ODD NOT DIVISIBLE BY 2
2 IS A EVEN PRIME NUMBER

EXPECTED VALUE
AVERAGE OF OUTCOMES BASED ON PROBABILITY

MEAN
AVERAGE= SUM OF VALUES/ NUMBER OF VALUES

VARIANCE
VARIANCE IS A NUMBER THAT TELLS US HOW SPREAD OUT THE DATA IS FROM THE AVERAGE(MEAN)

STANDARD DEVIATION
SQUARE ROOT OF VARIANCE

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
SHOWS ALL POSSIBLE OUTCOMES

BERNOULI DISTRIBUTION
ONLY ONE TRIAL
SHOWS TWO POSSIBLE OUTCOMES
SUCCESS OR FAILURE 
P= success
1-p = failure

BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION
EACH TRIAL HAS TWO OUTCOMES
DOING THE SAME EXPERIMENT 'n' NUMBER OF TIMES

NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
IT'S A CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTION
MEAN = MEDIAN = MODE
