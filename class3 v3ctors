Linear Equation:
A Linear Equation is an algebraic expression where the variables are raised to one.
Ax+By+C = 0 A,B,C are real numbers and x and y are variables each with a degree of1.
Example: Cost of a Ride-Sharing Service:
If a ride-sharing service charges a base fare of $2.50 and $1.25 per mile, you can use a linear equation to determine 
the total cost: Total Cost = 2.50 + 1.25 * Number of Miles. 
Let's say you travel 5 miles. The total cost would be $2.50 + $1.25 * 5 = $8.75. 
Vectors:
vector = Magnitude(length) + direction
A scalar vector has only one Magnitude.
Zero Vector: A vector with all components zero: (0, 0)

Unit Vector: A vector with a magnitude of 1

Position Vector: A vector from the origin to a point: (x, y)

Vector Space:
A vector space is a set of vectors that follows specific rules for vector addition and scalar multiplication.
Linear Independence:
A set of vectors is linearly independent if none of them can be written as a combination of the others
Example: v1=(1,2) v2=(2,4) these are dependent because v2=2v1
Basis:
A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that can generate the entire vector space through combinations.
Example: to make (3,2) 3*(1,0) + 2*(0,1) = (3,2) here basis for r*r={(1,0),(0,1)}
Rank:
The rank of a set of vectors (or a matrix) is the number of linearly independent vectors in it. 
Example: A= [1,0],[2,0] rows are dependent where rank is 1

MATRICES:
A Matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns
Types of Matrices
Row matrix [1,2,3]
Column matrix[1
              2]
Square matrix
Zero matrix
Diagonal matrix :Non-zero only on the diagonal
Identity matrix :1’s on diagonal, 0 elsewhere
Matrix Operations:
Addition & Subtraction
Scalar Multiplication: Multiply each element by a number
Matrix Multiplication: Multiply rows of 1st by columns of 2nd.
Determinant: 
A number calculated from a square matrix
used to check if a matrix is invertible
det(A) = ad-bc if A=[a b
                     c d]   
Inverse of a matrix: A inverse = (adj A)/(det A).
Transpose of a matrix: flip rows <-> columns
Eigenvector: Direction that doesn’t change
Eigenvalue: How much it stretches or shrinks
A⋅v=λ⋅v 
v is an eigenvector
λ is the eigenvalue
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduces data to fewer dimensions using top eigenvectors.
