RANDOM VARIABLE:
A FUNCTION THAT ASSIGNS NUMBERS TO OUTCOMES
EXAMPLE: PICK A MANGO 
X = {RIPE, UNRIPE} , WHERE X IS A RANDOM VARIABLE.

RANDOM EXPERIMENT: AN EXPERIMENT OR PROCESS OF UNCERTAIN OUTCOME(OUTCOME CANNOT BE PREDICTED)
EXAMPLE:PICK A MANGO

BASIC OUTCOME: ONE POSSIBLE OUTCOME OF A RANDOM EXPERIMENT
EXAMPLE: RIPE OR UNRIPE

OUTCOME: A RESULT OF CHANCE 
EXAMPLE: RIPE,UNRIPE
OUTPUT: A RESULT FROM ANY PROCESS
EXAMPLE: X=0 OR X=1

SAMPLE SPACE: ALL THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES
EXAMPLE:(RIPE,UNRIPE)

POPULATION: THE ENTIRE SET OF OUTCOMES
SUBSET: A SMALLER PART OF A SET WHOSE ELEMENTS CONTAINED IN ANOTHER SET
SUPERSET: A SET THAT INCLUDES ALL ELEMENTS OF ANOTHER SET

EVENT: A SUBSET OF THE SAMPLE SPACE
EXAMPLE: GETTING A = RIPE
GETTING B = UNRIPE

TYPES OF RANDOM VARIABLES
DISCRETE: COUNTABLE VALUES
EXAMPLE:X IS A DISCRETE POSSIBLE VALUES ARE 0,1

CONTINUOUS: INFINITE VALUES
EXAMPLE:NO CONTINUOUS HERE

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION: PROBABILITIES ARE ASSIGNED TO A VALUES OF A RANDOM VARIABLE
EXAMPLE: X=0 OUTCOME=RIPE PD=1/2
X=1 OUTCOME=UNRIPE PD=1/2

FUNCTIONS

PROBABILITY MASS FUNCTION: USED FOR DISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLES
EXAMPLE:
P(X=0)= RIPE
P(X=1) = UNRIPE
CUMMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION: USED FOR ANY RANDOM VARIABLE
EXAMPLE:
CD(0)= P(X<=0)= 1/2
CD(1)= P(X<=1)=1
PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNTION: USED FOR CONTINUOUS RANDOM VARIABLE
EXAMPLE: NO CONTINUOUS HERE

EXAMPLES: INSTAGRAM REELS LIKE SKIP OR WATCH
FLIGHT STATUS LIKE DELAYED OR ONTIME
